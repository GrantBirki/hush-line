# Hush Line
Hush Line is a reasonably secure and anonymous tip line that you can set up on your own domain name.

## Easy Install
ðŸ‘‰ We recommend using a Gmail account with a one-time password since we store passwords in plaintext.
Your messages are encrypted, so Google won't be able to read their contents.

### Tor + Public Web
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/hush-line/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Tor-Only
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/hush-line/main/scripts/install-tor-only.sh | bash
```

## Hush Line Go
Take Hush Line with you when you're on the go to make sharing your address easy. With the e-paper display, once the text is written, it will remain indefinitely without requiring power.

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/hush-line/main/scripts/companion-device.sh | bash
```

This device displays the encoded URL for your main Hush Line app, instructions, and the owner's info. Notably, when the device is plugged in, it acts as a listener for your tip line, pinging its address every minute and reporting when it was last seen. So if your server's availability is impacted, you'll know immediately.

And since this device only points to your main Hush Line app and contains no sensitive data, you don't have to worry if you lose it.

## Add a Display
When hosted on a Raspberry Pi, you can optionally add an e-ink display that makes it easy for people in your phycial location to discover and access your Hush Line. Teachers can place one on their desks in a classroom, a school can host one in the common area where students gather, or a manager can have one in a team's collaboration space.
