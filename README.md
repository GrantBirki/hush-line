## Easy Install
ðŸ‘‰ We recommend using a Gmail account with a one-time password since we store passwords in plaintext.
Your messages are encrypted, so Google won't be able to read their contents.

### Tor + Public Web
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/hush-line/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Tor-Only
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/hush-line/main/scripts/install-tor-only.sh | bash
```

## Add a Display
When hosted on a Raspberry Pi, you can optionally add an e-ink display that makes it easy for people in your phycial location to discover and access your Hush Line. Teachers can place one on their desks in a classroom, a school can host one in the common area where students gather, or a manager can have one in a team's collaboration space.
